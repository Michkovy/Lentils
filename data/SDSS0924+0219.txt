#anomalous flux ratio and optical variability (Pooley et al. 2007).
#The two images without available spectra (C and D) show only
#a small optical variability and are not particularly prone to microlensing. In RXS J1131−1231, the most anomalous flux ratio
#is B/C and A is a saddle-point image (Sluse et al. 2006). Image
#D (the one with no available spectrum) also has an anomalous
#flux but is not more susceptible to microlensing than the other
#images. Thus, in three of the four incomplete quads there is no
#reason to suppose that we are biasing the sample toward image
#pairs with lower microlensing probability. The case of SDSS
#0924+0219 is more problematic. There are two sets of data for
#this object, one by Eigenbrod et al. (2006) based on observations of the low ionization lines [Mg ii] and [C iii], which, after
#two epochs of observation, reveals no difference between the
#line and continuum flux ratios of components A and B. The
#other set of data (Keeton et al. 2006) is based on Lyα observations (a high ionization emission line supposed to come from
#a smaller region than the low ionization emission lines) and
#microlensing is detected not only in the continuum but also in
#the emission lines. This implies that the baseline for no microlensing magnification cannot be defined and, consequently,
#we could not consider Keeton et al. (2006) results. Anyway, we
#have repeated (as a test) the entire maximum likelihood estimate
#procedure to derive α but now using for SDSS 0924+0219 the
#microlensing measurements by Keeton et al. (2006). The results
#are almost identical: α = 0.05+0.10

6.2.6.SDSS J0924+0219The lens SDSS J0924+0219 is not a typical cusp config-uration but rather more like a cross configuration. Never-theless, it does have what seems to be an enormous fluxratio anomaly. The anomaly appears as such a strongsuppression of one of the negative-parity images that thesystem was initially thought to have just three images,and the fourth image (D) was identified only after sub-traction of the three main images and the lens galaxy(Inada et al. 2003). Because image D is a factor of 14fainter than image A, the triplet ABD (withθ= 156◦andd/Rein= 2.1) hasRcuspvalues of 0.916±0.009 ing-band, 0.903±0.005 inr-band, and 0.894±0.005 ini-band. The good agreement between the different pass-bands suggests that there is little differential extinctionbetween the images. The weighted average of the mea-surements isRcusp= 0.901±0.003.The fact that SDSS J0924+0219 is not a tight cuspconfiguration means that smooth potentials can producea fairly broad distribution ofRcuspvalues (see Figure 8).Nevertheless, the observed value ofRcuspis so large thatit still lies well outside the predicted distribution.  Inother words, the anomaly in SDSS J0924+0219 is sostrong that it is identified by the cusp relation analy-sis even though the lens is not a proper cusp configura-tion. This conclusion is insensitive to changes in the in-put data of the Monte Carlo simulations, and is thereforerobust provided that the lens galaxy is early-type. Be-cause the smallest image separation is still relatively large(d/Rein= 2,θ= 156◦), a spiral galaxy might in prin-ciple have structure on scales appropriate to explain theanomaly. However, the strength of the anomaly wouldrequire significant structure, which would probably affectnot just image D but all four images; and there is no cur-rent evidence that the lens is a spiral (Inada et al. 2003).In any case, the flux ratio anomaly in SDSS J0924+0219indicates that there is some strong and interesting struc-ture in the lens potential that is generally incompatiblewith the known properties of the luminous componentsof early-type galaxies.
